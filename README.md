# Transcript Analysis with CLAN
This repository contains all the code and protocols to make sure transcripts follow CHAT guidelines and can be analysed by CLAN 

## Why CLAN? 
For more information about CLAN, go to: https://childes.talkbank.org/

As described in the CLAN manual... 

*If you are a researcher studying conversational interaction, language learning, or language disorders, you will want to learn to use CLAN because it will help you address basic research questions and explore many different language types. ... CLAN emphasizes the automatic computation of indices such as MLU, TTR, DSS, and IPSyn.  It also provides powerful methods for speeding transcription, linking transcripts to media, sending data to automatic acoustic analysis, and automatic computation of a wide range of morphosyntactic features.* 

## Converting existing transcripts for analysis in CLAN ##

Below are the protocols for converting existing transcripts to follow CHAT guidelines, which can be analysed by CLAN.
